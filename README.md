### Add New Dish page

This page have centered form with all the fields needed in order to create new dish. The most interesting part is how we handle adding ingredients and allergies. I wanted to make it easier for everything trying to add new dish so every ingredient is separated by **", "** *(comma and whitespace*.

### Edit Dish page

The for is exactly the same with the only difference  being that every field is pre-populated with the information from the existing model.
